# Rejection

You gotta lose to win.

The game has one rule:

**You must be rejected by a human being at least once per day.**

Ask for things outside your comfort zone, and you'll find yourself winning a lot more.

Win = 1 point.
Rejection = 10 points.

If you have wins and rejections on the same day, your `win` points are multiplied by 10.

How long can you make your rejection streak last?
