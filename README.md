You gotta lose to win.

Train yourself to:

* Get a raise
* Sell more
* Develop more business
* Negotiate better deals

The game has one rule:

**You must be rejected by a human being at least once per day.**

Ask for things outside your comfort zone, and you'll find yourself winning a lot more.

Win = 1 point.
Rejection = 10 points.

If you have wins and rejections on the same day, your `win` points are multiplied by 10.

How long can you make your rejection streak last?


## Basic Level

Build a UI that lets you keep track of your score. Include a text input for the ask, who you asked, and two buttons: "Accepted" or "rejected".

Use HTML+CSS and store a record of the data in `localStorage`.

Keep a running tally of the user's current score. Remember that the day's score needs to be recalculated each time an ask is accepted or rejected.


## Mid level

Add an API to store data using a web service and database. Hint: Redis or Mongo would be good candidates.


## Advanced level

Share your score and compete with your friends on Facebook.


## Extra credit

Add mobile apps
